Smart Agriculture system based on IoT
This Project is a software based project which involves development of Web Application  using Node-RED Programming tool.This basically involves taking the data from IBM Watson Simulator to the IBM Watson IOT platform through IBM  Cloud and then displaying it through an App, i.e.creating a UI using different Nodes in NODE-RED Programming Tool.The Node-RED flow chart is in the JSON format.

It also includeswriting a Python code inorder to configure the devices using web application which has been already created.It is necessary to download Ibmiotf package so that it can connect to the device and we can run the code easily.
